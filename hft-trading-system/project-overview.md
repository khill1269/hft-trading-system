## Important Files for Reference

When continuing development in a new chat, upload the following key file:
`project-overview.md` (this file)

This will provide the context needed to continue development without uploading all files.

## Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

## Contact & Resources

- Project Repository: [URL]
- Documentation: [URL]
- Issue Tracker: [URL]

## Notes for Continuation

When continuing development:
1. Upload this overview file first
2. Specify which component you want to work on
3. Request specific related files as needed

This approach will help maintain context while optimizing resource usage.
